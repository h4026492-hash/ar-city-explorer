## Day Before

### Rehearsal Session (30 minutes)

**Round 1 — Script Read-Through**
1. Open demo script
2. Read every line out loud while doing the actions
3. Time yourself — should be 2:30–3:00
4. Note any awkward transitions

**Round 2 — Without Script**
1. Do the demo from memory
2. Use bullet points only if needed
3. Focus on natural pacing, not perfection
4. Record yourself (audio or video)

**Round 3 — Q&A Practice**
1. Have someone ask you 5 random questions from the Q&A doc
2. Answer without looking
3. If you stumble, note the question and practice it

### Mental Prep
- [ ] Visualize the demo going well
- [ ] Accept that small mistakes happen — they don't matter
- [ ] Remember: investors want you to succeed
- [ ] Sleep well — tired founders don't demo well

- [ ] Test audio / microphone
- [ ] Position phone for easy screen share

## During the Demo

### Pacing Rules
| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| ✅ Pause between sections | ❌ Don't rush through |
| ✅ Let the app do the work | ❌ Don't over-explain |
| ✅ Make eye contact at key moments | ❌ Don't stare at the screen |
| ✅ Use silence for effect | ❌ Don't fill every second with words |

### If Something Breaks
1. **Stay calm** — don't apologize profusely
2. Say: "Let me show you this another way"
3. Switch to backup recording if needed
4. Or describe what *would* happen: "Normally, you'd see..."
5. Move on — don't dwell

### Power Phrases
- "Let me show you" — always stronger than explaining
- "This is the core experience" — signals importance
- "Notice how..." — directs attention
- "This is not [X], it's [Y]" — creates contrast
- "Any questions so far?" — invites engagement

## After the Demo

### Immediate (within 5 minutes)
- [ ] Thank them for their time
- [ ] Ask: "What questions do you have?"
- [ ] Listen more than you talk
- [ ] Offer to send investor memo PDF

### Same Day
- [ ] Send follow-up email with:
  - Thank you
  - Demo video link (if recorded)
  - Investor memo PDF
  - One clear next step ("Would you like to schedule a follow-up?")

### Within 48 Hours
- [ ] Note feedback in a document
- [ ] Update Q&A answers based on new questions
- [ ] If they said no, ask: "What would need to change for you to reconsider?"

## Confidence Mindset

### Truths to Remember

1. **You built something real.** Most people only talk. You shipped.

2. **Investors see 100 pitches.** Yours shows a working product — that's rare.

3. **Demo Mode exists for a reason.** You prepared. You're not winging it.

4. **Imperfection is human.** A small bug mid-demo can actually build trust if you handle it gracefully.

5. **This is practice.** Even if this meeting doesn't convert, you're getting reps. The next one will be better.

### Pre-Demo Mantra (Say Out Loud)

> "I know my product. I know my numbers. I'm here to show, not to sell. Let's go."

---

## Emergency Backup Plan

If the live demo completely fails:

1. **Switch to pre-recorded video** (have MP4 on laptop)
2. **Use screenshots** (have 5 key screens ready)
3. **Describe the experience** with confidence:
   > "What you'd see is AR cards appearing over real buildings, and when you tap one, the AI explains what you're looking at. It's designed to feel like a local expert walking with you."

The backup is a safety net. You probably won't need it.
