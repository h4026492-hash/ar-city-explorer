## 0:00–0:10 — OPENING (HOOK)

> 
> AR City Explorer changes that by turning the real world into the interface using AI and augmented reality."

**Action:** Pause. Open the app.

---

## 0:10–0:30 — APP LAUNCH (ZERO FRICTION)

**Action:** Tap **Start Demo**.

> "Right away, the app opens the camera and places AR cards on real landmarks around downtown Dallas."

**Action:** Let AR cards appear.

---

## 0:30–1:00 — CORE MAGIC (AR + AI)

> "Each card is anchored using GPS and compass data, so it stays fixed in the real world."

**Action:** Tap **Reunion Tower** card.

> "Instead of generic facts, the AI explains what you're seeing from where you're standing, adapting to your interests and walking context."

**Action:** Let the explanation load. Scroll slightly.

> "This is not navigation. It's understanding."

---

## 1:00–1:25 — SMART WALK MODE

**Action:** Tap **Start Walk**.

> "Smart Walk Mode guides you through the city automatically, surfacing the next landmark as you move, without forcing you to plan routes."

**Action:** Show "Next landmark ahead" prompt.

> "This makes exploration feel intentional instead of random."

---

## 1:25–1:45 — OFFLINE + PREMIUM VALUE

**Action:** Navigate to **Offline Pack** or mention it visually.

> "Premium users can download entire city packs, so everything works even without internet.
> 
> AI explanations are cached and reused, which also keeps backend costs low."

---

## 1:45–2:05 — MONETIZATION (CLEAR + CLEAN)

> "This is a freemium product.
> 
> Free users can explore a limited number of landmarks.
> 
> Premium unlocks unlimited exploration, guided walking tours, offline city packs, and AI memory across sessions."

**Action:** Briefly show paywall or premium badge.

> "No ads. No clutter."

## 2:05–2:25 — SCALE STORY

**Action:** Optionally switch city.

> "Each city adds new revenue without changing the core technology."

---

## 2:25–2:45 — CLOSE (VISION)

> "Our vision is to become the default way people understand cities, starting with major U.S. cities and expanding globally."

**Action:** Stop recording on AR view.

> "This is AR City Explorer."
