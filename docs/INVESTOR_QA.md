# Investor Q&A — Prepared Answers

Use these word-for-word or adapt to your style. Practice until they feel natural.

## Product & Technology

### "How does the AR actually work?"

> "We use GPS and the device compass to anchor AR cards to real-world coordinates. When you point your phone at a landmark, the app calculates the bearing and distance, then overlays a card that stays fixed in 3D space as you move. It's not image recognition — it's spatial positioning, which means it works on any building without pre-scanning."

### "What if GPS is inaccurate?"

> "Consumer GPS is accurate to about 5–10 meters, which is enough for landmark-scale experiences. We also use compass smoothing and heading filters to reduce jitter. For version 2, we're exploring ARKit's world tracking to improve precision indoors and in dense urban areas."

### "Why not use image recognition instead?"

> "Image recognition requires pre-training on every building, which doesn't scale. GPS works anywhere with coordinates. We can add a new city in hours, not weeks. Image recognition is a future enhancement for specific high-value landmarks, but GPS is the right foundation for scale."

### "How do you generate AI explanations?"

> "We use a context-aware prompt system. The AI receives your location, the landmark you're viewing, your selected interests, and whether you're walking. It generates a natural, conversational explanation — not a Wikipedia dump. We also cache responses to reduce API costs and enable offline mode."

## Business Model

### "Why subscriptions instead of ads?"

> "Ads destroy the experience. When you're standing in front of a historic building, you don't want a banner interrupting the moment. Subscriptions align our incentives with users: we make money when we deliver value, not when we distract. Premium users also have higher lifetime value and lower churn."

### "What's your pricing strategy?"

> "We show yearly first at $29.99/year — that's about $2.50/month. Monthly is $4.99 for users who want flexibility. Founding members during our launch period get a lifetime price lock. This creates urgency to subscribe early and rewards our earliest believers."

### "What's your expected conversion rate?"

> "Industry benchmarks for travel apps are 2–5% free-to-paid. We're optimizing for 'aha moment' timing — showing the paywall after users experience 3 AI explanations, so they understand the value before we ask. Early signals will tell us if we're above or below benchmark."

### "How do you retain subscribers?"

> "Three things: AI memory that gets smarter over time, weekly discovery digests with personalized recommendations, and new city packs they can download. The product gets more valuable the longer you use it, which reduces churn."

## Market & Competition

### "Who's your competition?"

> "Google Maps shows you where things are, but not what they mean. Yelp and TripAdvisor are review aggregators. Museum audio guides are indoor-only. Generic AR apps have no content. We're the only product combining AR + AI + city-scale exploration with personalized context. The closest comparison is 'an AI tour guide in your pocket.'"

### "What if Google builds this?"

> "Google could, but they probably won't. Their business model is ads and local search — they want you to find a restaurant, not understand a building. This is a vertical product for a passionate niche, not a horizontal platform play. We can move faster, go deeper, and build a brand that Google can't replicate."

### "How big is the market?"

> "The travel app market is $12B+ and growing. AR mobile apps are $15B+ by 2028. But the real opportunity is becoming the default way people understand cities — that's a new category, not a slice of an existing one. We're building the 'Duolingo of city exploration.'"

## Traction & Metrics

### "What's your current traction?"

> "We're live on iOS with two cities — Dallas and Austin. Full AR + AI functionality, offline packs, premium subscriptions. We built demo mode specifically for investor meetings so you can see the product without being in Dallas."

*(Add real numbers when available: downloads, DAU, conversion rate, revenue)*

### "How do you measure success?"

> "Three key metrics: landmarks explained per session (engagement), free-to-premium conversion (monetization), and monthly retention (product-market fit). We track everything through our analytics pipeline and run A/B tests on paywall timing and messaging."

### "When will you be profitable?"

> "This is a scale play, so profitability comes after we hit critical mass in 20+ cities. But unit economics are strong: AI API costs are pennies per explanation, and we cache aggressively. Each premium subscriber is profitable from month one."

---

## Scalability

### "How do you add a new city?"

> "Each city requires landmark coordinates (public data), AI prompt templates (reusable), and a one-time offline pack generation (automated). We added Austin in under a day using the same pipeline as Dallas. The marginal cost is near zero."

### "How many cities can you support?"

> "There's no technical limit. We're targeting 20 U.S. cities in Year 1, then expanding to Europe and Asia. Each city adds new revenue without changing the core technology. It's a content library model, like Netflix adding new shows."

### "What's stopping someone from copying you?"

> "Three things: our AI prompt system that generates genuinely good explanations (not obvious to replicate), our city data pipeline that lets us move fast, and brand recognition as the first mover in this space. By the time someone copies us, we'll be in 50 cities with loyal users."

## Team & Fundraising

### "Why are you the right person to build this?"

> "I've been obsessed with city exploration for years, and I realized no one has combined AR, AI, and mobile in a way that actually feels magical. I'm a technical founder who can ship product fast — I built this entire app myself. I'm not waiting for a team; I'm building and learning in parallel."

### "What's your fundraising plan?"

> "We're raising a seed round of $[X] to expand to 20 cities, build out the team, and reach Series A metrics. This raise gets us to 50,000+ downloads, meaningful ARR, and proof that the model scales."

### "What's the biggest risk?"

> "Honestly, it's distribution. The product works, the model is clear, but getting users to discover us is the hardest part. We're planning a mix of App Store optimization, content marketing, and partnerships with travel creators. If we crack distribution, everything else follows."

### "What if this doesn't work?"

> "The core technology — AR + AI + mobile — has other applications: real estate, retail, education, museums. If city exploration doesn't scale, we pivot to a vertical that does. But I believe this category is real, and we're building the right product."

## Quick Tips

- **Pause after answering** — let them ask the next question
- **Don't over-explain** — 30–60 seconds max per answer
- **If you don't know, say so** — "That's a great question. I don't have data on that yet, but here's how I'd think about it..."
- **Redirect to demo** — "Let me show you in the app" is always a strong move
