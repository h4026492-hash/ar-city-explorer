# 30-Second Elevator Pitch

## The Pitch (Memorize This)

> "AR City Explorer turns the real world into an interactive guide using augmented reality and AI.
>
> You point your phone at a building, and instead of generic Wikipedia facts, you get a personalized explanation based on where you're standing and what you're interested in.
>
> We launched in Dallas, just added Austin, and each new city adds revenue without changing the core technology.
>
> We're raising a seed round to expand to 20 U.S. cities this year."

## Variations

### If They Ask "What Do You Do?"

> "I'm building AR City Explorer — it's like having a local expert in your pocket that uses augmented reality to explain what you're looking at in any city."

### If They Ask "How Does It Make Money?"

> "Freemium subscriptions. Free users get limited landmarks. Premium unlocks unlimited exploration, offline city packs, and AI memory — $4.99/month or $29.99/year."

### If They Ask "What's Your Traction?"

> "We're live in Dallas and Austin with full AR + AI functionality. We have [X] downloads and [X]% of users convert to premium after seeing 3+ landmarks."

*(Fill in real numbers when you have them)*

### If They Ask "Why You?"

> "I've been obsessed with city exploration for years, and I realized no one has combined AR, AI, and mobile in a way that actually feels magical. I built this because I wanted it to exist."

## Practice Tips

1. **Say it out loud 10 times** — muscle memory matters
2. **Time yourself** — should be 25–30 seconds, not faster
3. **End with eye contact** — don't trail off
4. **Pause after "this year"** — let them respond
5. **Don't over-explain** — if they're interested, they'll ask
