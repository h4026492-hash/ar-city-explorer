# AR City Explorer

## One-Page Investor Memo

---

### The Problem

**City exploration is broken.**

Tourists and locals use maps, guides, and search engines to learn about places — but none of these tools explain what you're *actually looking at* in real-time. The result: passive, disconnected experiences where the city itself stays silent.

---

### The Solution

**AR City Explorer turns the real world into the interface.**

Point your phone at any landmark. Using GPS, compass, and AI, the app overlays AR cards on real buildings and delivers personalized explanations based on:

- Where you're standing
- What you're interested in
- Your walking context

This is not navigation. It's *understanding*.

### Market Opportunity

| Segment | Size |
|---------|------|
| **Global travel apps market** | $12B+ by 2027 |
| **AR mobile apps market** | $15B+ by 2028 |
| **Target users** | Tourists, urban explorers, history enthusiasts, locals |

**Initial focus:** Major U.S. cities (20 cities in Year 1)

**Expansion:** Europe, Asia, global landmarks

---

### Scalability

Each new city requires:

- Landmark GPS coordinates (public data)
- AI prompt templates (reusable)
- Offline pack generation (automated)

**Marginal cost per city: Near zero.**

Revenue scales linearly with city count. Technology stays fixed.

### Competitive Advantage

| Competitor | Gap |
|------------|-----|
| Google Maps | No AR explanations, no personalization |
| Yelp / TripAdvisor | Reviews, not real-time understanding |
| Museum audio guides | Indoor only, not city-scale |
| Generic AR apps | No AI, no context, no content |

**AR City Explorer is the only product combining AR + AI + city-scale exploration.**
